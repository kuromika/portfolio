                  <p>My name is Jean, also known as Kuromika on social media.  Iâ€™m a highly driven self-taught web developer. I have honed my skills through extensive experimentation and hands-on projects, and I am constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to improve my craft.</p> <p className="mt-3"> When I am not coding, I like to immerse myself in the eclectic world of Japanese math rock and shoegaze music, drawing inspiration from their complex rhythms and ethereal soundscapes. </p>

          <p>
            My name is Jean, also known as Kuromika on social media. Iâ€™m a
            highly driven self-taught web developer. I have honed my skills
            through extensive experimentation and hands-on projects, and I am
            constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to improve
            my craft.

            When I am not coding, I like to immerse myself in the eclectic world
            of Japanese math rock and shoegaze music, drawing inspiration from
            their complex rhythms and ethereal soundscapes.{" "}
